Welcome to PlanktonPy's documentation!
===========================================

PlanktonPy is a trait-based and size-structured numerical plankton ecosystem modeled within parameter space. 

PlanktonPy is lightweight, and can be run in parallel when coupled with multiprocessing. Additionally, PlanktonPy can be projected into physical arrays such as maps or earth system model output when coupled with pyGAM.
